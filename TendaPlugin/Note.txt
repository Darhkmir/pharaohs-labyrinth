Yoh Dusty! Sorry it took so long, a long way from your birthday haha.
I know the game was absolutely awful, but I hope you at least enjoy
these two gifts.

The first is that youtube banner! I didn't forget, but I also don't
really think it's finished. I didn't know what else to add, so I
thought I just send it like this and you let me know.

The second is the big one. A little phone app I made for phrases
in out favorite language! Though you can't add your own, it is
connected to a server so I can update the phrases whenever and
it'll appear in the app as long as your restart it. I'll add
a restart button later and maybe also offline functionality,
maybe even more feature, so look forward to it!

Anyway, have a great day. I can finaly take the week end off xD

Lmk when you wanna play some more games together.
